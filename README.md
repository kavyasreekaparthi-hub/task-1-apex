# Basic Web Development Demo

## Objective
This repository demonstrates foundational web development concepts using **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in a single self-contained file.

## Features
- **HTML**: Basic structure with headings, paragraphs, an image, and a link.
- **CSS**: Embedded styling including responsive layout, custom variables, shadows, hover effects, and typography.
- **JavaScript**: Simple interactivity â€” a button triggers an alert and updates on-page feedback.

## Files
- `index.html`: The complete example. Open it in any browser to view and interact.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click the "Click me!" button to see JavaScript interactivity in action.

## Customization Ideas
- Replace the placeholder image with your own.
- Add more interactive elements (e.g., form validation, dynamic content).
- Separate CSS and JS into their own files (`style.css`, `script.js`) for scalability.
